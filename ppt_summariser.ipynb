       "# Cheat-Sheet: Theoretical Perspectives on Media and Technology\n",
       "\n",
       "## Introduction to Media and Technology\n",
       "- **Impact of Technology**: Transforms communication, social interaction, and perception of the world. \n",
       "- **Examples**: Using Facebook for connection, technology for daily tasks, and constant connectivity leading to distractions.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Technological Inequality\n",
       "- **Digital Divide**: Gap between those with and without access to technology.\n",
       "- **Knowledge Gap**: Differences in knowledge levels based on information access.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Evolution of Media\n",
       "- **Interwoven Relationship**: Media relies on technology; both influence society.\n",
       "- **Historical Impact**: The printing press revolutionized information dissemination, with tech advancements continuing to transform media.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Types of Media and Concerns\n",
       "- **Media Forms**: Comics, movies, websites, newspapers, etc.\n",
       "- **Violent Media Debate**: Concerns over behaviors linked to violent games (e.g., GTA).\n",
       "  - **Research Findings**: Link between violent games and aggression (Anderson and Bushman, 2001).\n",
       "  - **Regulations**: ERSB rating system for games (1994); Supreme Court ruling on minors (2011).\n",
       "\n",
       "## Global Implications of Media and Technology\n",
       "- **Connecting People and Economies**: Importance of personal computing and the internet (Friedman's \"The World is Flat\").\n",
       "\n",
       "## Case Studies and Real-World Impact\n",
       "- **Government Censorship**: Alternatives to Western media; use of social media for government critiques.\n",
       "- **Market Access**: Shared-phone programs and money transfers.\n",
       "- **Cultural Imperialism Concerns**: Examined through case studies, such as mobile phones in Sub-Saharan Africa and China's internet.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Theoretical Perspectives on Media and Technology\n",
       "\n",
       "### Functionalism\n",
       "- **Roles of Media**:\n",
       "  - Commercial: Advertising.\n",
       "  - Entertainment: Gaming, TV, social networking.\n",
       "  - Social-Norm: Socialization tool.\n",
       "  - Life-Changing: Access to digital resources.\n",
       "- **Functions**: Shape perceptions and social cohesion, but may lead to dysfunctions like over-commercialization, digital addiction, and media-induced anxiety.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conflict Theory\n",
       "- **Media Control**: Power dynamics; gatekeeping by individuals and institutions.\n",
       "- **Money Influence**: Those with wealth have increased visibility in media.\n",
       "- **Digital Control**: Surveillance and tracking via technology (panoptic surveillance).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Feminist Perspective\n",
       "- **Media Influence**: Beauty standards affect women's self-image and enforce gender stereotypes.\n",
       "- **Cyber-Feminism**: Promotion of feminist ideals through digital platforms (e.g., #MeToo Movement, body positivity).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Symbolic Interactionism\n",
       "- **Symbolism of Technology**: Represents wealth and status; interpretations vary (e.g., Neo-Luddites vs. Technophiles).\n",
       "- **Social Construction of Reality**: Media shapes our worldview and influences how we see social groups.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Question Bank\n",
       "1. **What is the digital divide?**\n",
       "   - The gap between individuals with access to technology and those without.\n",
       "   \n",
       "2. **How has the printing press impacted information sharing?**\n",
       "   - It revolutionized the dissemination of information, making it more accessible to the public.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **What concerns are associated with violent video games?**\n",
       "   - They are linked to aggressive behavior and have prompted regulatory responses.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **What is gatekeeping in media?**\n",
       "   - The process by which selected messages are filtered and shaped for mass media consumption.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **How does feminist perspective critique media?**\n",
       "   - It highlights how media perpetuates beauty standards, gender stereotypes, and contributes to the gender gap in tech fields.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **What role does technology play in surveillance?**\n",
       "   - Technology facilitates constant monitoring and tracking of individuals' movements (panoptic surveillance).\n",
