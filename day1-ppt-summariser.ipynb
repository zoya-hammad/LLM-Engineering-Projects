       "# Cheat-Sheet: Theoretical Perspectives on Media and Technology\n",
       "\n",
       "## Introduction to Media and Technology\n",
       "- **Impact of Technology:** Transforms daily interactions; enhances connectivity through social media (e.g., Facebook).\n",
       "- **Influence:** Affects communication, socialization, and perception of the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Technological Inequality\n",
       "- **Digital Divide:** Gap between those with and without access to technology.\n",
       "- **Knowledge Gap:** Differences in knowledge based on socioeconomic status.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Evolution of Media\n",
       "- **Interwoven Relationship:** Media and technology influence each other.\n",
       "- **Historical Impact:** The printing press revolutionized information; rapid technological advances continue to change media.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Types of Media Technology\n",
       "- **Examples:** Comics, Movies, Websites, Newspapers.\n",
       "- **Concerns:** Link between violent video games and aggressive behavior (Anderson and Bushman, 2001).\n",
       "- **Regulations:**\n",
       "  - ERSB rating system for video games (1994).\n",
       "  - Supreme Court ruling on minors accessing video games (2011).\n",
       "\n",
       "## Global Implications of Media and Technology\n",
       "- **Connecting People:** Thomas Friedmanâ€™s \"The World is Flat\" emphasizes the role of computing and the internet in globalization.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Case Studies\n",
       "- **Government Censorship:** Local alternatives to Western social media; using social media for critique amidst restrictions.\n",
       "- **Mobile Phones in Sub-Saharan Africa:** Increased market access and money transfers.\n",
       "- **China and the Internet:** Examples of information control and technology's role in society.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Theoretical Perspectives\n",
       "\n",
       "### Functionalism\n",
       "- **Media Functions:**\n",
       "  - **Commercial:** Advertising platform.\n",
       "  - **Entertainment:** Various forms of media.\n",
       "  - **Social-Norm:** Socializing tool.\n",
       "  - **Life-Changing:** Enhances access to information.\n",
       "- **Manifest Functions:** Shape reality perceptions, impact language, and social cohesion.\n",
       "- **Dysfunctions:** Over-commercialization, excessive media consumption, digital addiction, privacy concerns.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conflict Theory\n",
       "- **Gatekeeping:** Influential figures control media; selective information is given to the public.\n",
       "- **Digital Control:** Surveillance and monitoring of behavior.\n",
       "- **Unbalanced Political Arena:** Financial power influences media exposure.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Feminist Perspective\n",
       "- **Media Representation:** Exclusion of diverse beauty and reinforcement of stereotypes.\n",
       "- **Cyber-Feminism:** Advocacy for women's representation and rights in the digital realm.\n",
       "- **Movements:** #MeToo, body positivity, blogs by Iraqi women.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Symbolic Interactionism\n",
       "- **Symbolism of Technology:** Represents wealth/status differently perceived by various groups (Neo-Luddites vs. Technophiles).\n",
       "- **Media's Role:** Shapes how reality is understood and creates societal frameworks for comparison.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Questions and Answers\n",
       "1. **What is Technological Stratification?**\n",
       "   - Differences in access to technology leading to unequal opportunities.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **What is the 'Digital Divide'?**\n",
       "   - The gap between those who have access to digital technology and those who do not.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **What are the risks associated with violent video games?**\n",
       "   - Linked to increased aggression and desensitization to violence.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **What does 'gatekeeping' refer to?**\n",
       "   - The process of filtering and determining what information is presented in the media.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **What is the significance of the ERSB rating system?**\n",
       "   - It provides a framework for assessing the content of video games to inform consumers.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Define Cyber-Feminism.**\n",
       "   - Promoting feminism and women's representation within the digital and online spaces.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **What does 'panoptic surveillance' refer to?**\n",
       "   - Constant digital monitoring without direct communication, such as through security cameras.\n",
